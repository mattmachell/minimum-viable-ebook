minimum-viable-ebook
====================

Experiment in appcache powered ebooks with urls. Since ePub is basically HTML anyway, can't we cut out the app in the middle?

Currently the only example is based on Clinton Nixon's Creative Commons licensed RPG text, The Shadow of Yesterday.

See examples in action on the [example pages](http://mattmachell.github.com/minimum-viable-ebook/)
